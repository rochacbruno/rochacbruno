> In 2024 I decided to move my whole development environment to [KDE](https://kde.org/),
> after 25 years working on Linux and open-source and tried multiple distros, DE and WMs.
> I figured out that [KDE Plasma](https://kde.org/ia/announcements/megarelease/6/) became the platform, framework and desktop experience I always wanted to see on Linux.
> I started following KDE developers and community and it is really good to see how this community
> keeps the [free-software philosofy](https://manifesto.kde.org/) so alive and create applications with privacy and freedom as a top level priority.
> I am interested in getting involved in KDE development looking forward for the [Eco goals](https://eco.kde.org/)
> and very interested in the future of [Plasma Mobile](https://plasma-mobile.org/).
